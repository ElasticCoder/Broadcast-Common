You can read this online manual through any frames-capable Web 
browser. For best results, use the latest version of Netscape 
Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. This manual is 
intended to be read from your local computer, either from your hard 
disk or the RealNetworks product CD.

Macintosh Users: If browsing with Microsoft Internet Explorer, 
use version 4.01 or higher to avoid display problems.

OPENING THE MANUAL

With your Web browser, open the main HTML file that resides in the 
top folder (the same folder as this README file). This file sets 
up the frames and links to the other HTML files. The subfolders in 
this main folder contain the content files:

* graphics--GIF files used to illustrate the manual.
* htmfiles--HTML pages that contain the documentation.
* icons--GIF files used as icons throughout the manual.
* media--multimedia examples.
* styles--cascading style sheets used to format the manual.
* utils--utilities (omitted if no utilities are needed).

USING MULTIMEDIA EXAMPLES

Media examples in this online manual are meant to be played back from
your desktop machine. They are not configured to stream from a server. 
You may have difficulty playing them if, for example, a Web server is 
serving this manual or the manual's files reside on another machine
you are accessing through file sharing.

MOVING THE MANUAL

This manual uses relative hypertext links between files. You can move 
it to any place on your computer as long as you maintain its relative
structure. You can rename the top folder and the main HTML file if 
you wish. Other files and folders must retain their original names.
All files follow 8x3 DOS naming conventions.

PRINTING ERRORS

Netscape Navigator may fail to print out large HTML files in this
manual properly. To work around this problem, you can do either of the
following:

- Print the file with Microsoft Internet Explorer.
- Remove the stylesheet link from the HTML source file header and 
  print the file with Navigator.

RealNetworks also provides this manual in Adobe Acrobat PDF. The
PDF version includes page numbers in cross references, making
it more useful than the HTML version when printed. PDF manuals 
are available at http://service.real.com/help/library/index.html.
